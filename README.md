## Overview

Newsbloom is an application that serves news data in a similar manner to websites such as Reddit. It serves articles and user data to clients, and allows interaction through votes and comments.

## User Guide

From the application's homepage, users can use the filter bar to specify the criteria for viewing news articles. Users can interact with selected articles by upvoting/downvoting and by posting comments. The application has a default user logged in (cooljmessy). When logging out and logging in as a guest, the ability to interact with articles is removed.
